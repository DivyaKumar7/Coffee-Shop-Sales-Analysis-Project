## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation & Cleaning
### SQL Tasks Performed:
- **Date Formatting**: Converted `transaction_date` to `DATE` and `transaction_time` to `TIME`.
- **Column Name Corrections**: Renamed columns for consistency.
- **Derived Metrics**: Created measures like `Total Sales`, `Orders per Month`, and `Quantities Sold`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Month-wise Total Sales
SELECT MONTHNAME(transaction_date) AS month, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY month;

-- Sales by Product Category
SELECT product_category, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY product_category;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è DAX Measures
Some of the key DAX measures used:

```DAX
-- Total Sales
sales = 'coffee_shop_sales'[transaction_qty] * 'coffee_shop_sales'[unit_price]

-- Month-on-Month Sales Comparison
Sales MOM Comparison = 
VAR Difference = [Current Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales]
VAR PercentChange = DIVIDE(Difference, [Previous Month Sales], 0)
RETURN PercentChange

-- Category Sales Label
Label for Category = 
SELECTEDVALUE('coffee_shop_sales'[product_category]) & " | " & FORMAT(ROUND([Total Sales]/1000, 1), "0.#") & "K"
```
