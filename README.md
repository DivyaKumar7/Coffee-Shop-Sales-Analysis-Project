# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## üìã Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of sales and order data for a coffee shop. The goal is to extract actionable insights and present them in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. The project involved cleaning and exploring the data using **MySQL**, performing various calculations and aggregations with SQL queries, and designing advanced visualizations in **Power BI** using **DAX functions**, tooltips, and slicers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation & Cleaning
### SQL Tasks Performed:
- **Date Formatting**: Converted `transaction_date` to `DATE` and `transaction_time` to `TIME`.
- **Column Name Corrections**: Renamed columns for consistency.
- **Derived Metrics**: Created measures like `Total Sales`, `Orders per Month`, and `Quantities Sold`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Month-wise Total Sales
SELECT MONTHNAME(transaction_date) AS month, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY month;

-- Sales by Product Category
SELECT product_category, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY product_category;

-- Month on Month increase/decrease in sales (%)

DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(month_number INT) 
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	DECLARE sales_diff DECIMAL(10,2);
    WITH monthly_sales AS(
	SELECT MONTH(transaction_date) AS month_no, SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS total_sales
	FROM coffee_shop_sales
	GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date))

	SELECT ((SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = month_number) - 
		   (SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = (month_number-1))) / 
           (SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = (month_number-1)) * 100 
            INTO sales_diff;
    RETURN sales_diff;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;

SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(2) AS feb_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(3) AS mar_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(4) AS apr_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(6) AS june_d;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è DAX Measures
Some of the key DAX measures used:

```DAX
-- Total Sales
sales = 'coffee_shop_sales'[transaction_qty] * 'coffee_shop_sales'[unit_price]

-- Month-on-Month Sales Comparison
Sales MOM Comparison = 
VAR Difference = [Current Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales]
VAR PercentChange = DIVIDE(Difference, [Previous Month Sales], 0)
RETURN PercentChange

-- Category Sales Label
Label for Category = 
SELECTEDVALUE('coffee_shop_sales'[product_category]) & " | " & FORMAT(ROUND([Total Sales]/1000, 1), "0.#") & "K"
```
