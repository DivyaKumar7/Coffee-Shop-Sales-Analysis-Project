# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## üìã Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of sales and order data for a coffee shop. The goal is to extract actionable insights and present them in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. The project involved cleaning and exploring the data using **MySQL**, performing various calculations and aggregations with SQL queries, and designing advanced visualizations in **Power BI** using **DAX functions**, tooltips, and slicers.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Files
This repository contains:
1. **SQL Scripts**: Queries used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive report showcasing key metrics and trends.
3. **Dataset**: Sales and order data (sanitized and structured).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation & Cleaning
### SQL Tasks Performed:
- **Date Formatting**: Converted `transaction_date` to `DATE` and `transaction_time` to `TIME`.
- **Column Name Corrections**: Renamed columns for consistency.
- **Derived Metrics**: Created measures like `Total Sales`, `Orders per Month`, and `Quantities Sold`.

**Sample SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Month-wise Total Sales
SELECT MONTHNAME(transaction_date) AS month, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY month;

-- Sales by Product Category
SELECT product_category, 
       SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
GROUP BY product_category;

-- Month on Month increase/decrease in sales (%)

DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(month_number INT) 
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
	DECLARE sales_diff DECIMAL(10,2);
    WITH monthly_sales AS(
	SELECT MONTH(transaction_date) AS month_no, SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) AS total_sales
	FROM coffee_shop_sales
	GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date))

	SELECT ((SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = month_number) - 
		   (SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = (month_number-1))) / 
           (SELECT total_sales
			FROM monthly_sales
			WHERE month_no = (month_number-1)) * 100 
            INTO sales_diff;
    RETURN sales_diff;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;

SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(2) AS feb_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(3) AS mar_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(4) AS apr_d;
SELECT get_salesdiff_from_previous_month(6) AS june_d;
```

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

- **Key Metrics Cards**: Total Sales, Total Orders, and Quantities Sold.
- **Trends Visualizations**:
  - Monthly Sales Growth (% and absolute values).
  - Sales distribution by time (hour, day, month).
  - Product category sales comparisons.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - **DAX Measures**: For dynamic calculations such as month-on-month comparisons.
  - **Tooltips**: Hover-over insights for detailed breakdowns.
  - **Filters and Slicers**: Location, product category, and time filters.

## ‚ú® Key Insights
### From SQL Analysis:
1. Monthly Sales Trends
2. Product Performance
3. Sales in different locations

### From Power BI Dashboard:
1. **Top 3 Product Categories**: Highlighted in a Bar chart with their respective sales contributions.
2. **Weekday vs. Weekend Sales**:
   - Weekends accounted for around 25% of total sales.
3. **Dynamic Tooltips**: Enhanced data storytelling by providing granular insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è DAX Measures
Some of the key DAX measures used:

```DAX
-- Total Sales
sales = 'coffee_shop_sales'[transaction_qty] * 'coffee_shop_sales'[unit_price]

-- Month-on-Month Sales Comparison
Sales MOM Comparison = 
VAR Difference = [Current Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales]
VAR PercentChange = DIVIDE(Difference, [Previous Month Sales], 0)
RETURN PercentChange

-- Category Sales Label
Label for Category = 
SELECTEDVALUE('coffee_shop_sales'[product_category]) & " | " & FORMAT(ROUND([Total Sales]/1000, 1), "0.#") & "K"
```

## üìà Sample Dashboard Visuals
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: A line chart with month-on-month growth annotations.
- **Hourly Sales Distribution**: Sales heatmap Calendar wise and Hour wise.
